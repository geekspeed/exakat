[{"name":"output_buffering","suggested":"4096","documentation":"You can enable output buffering for all files by setting this directive to 'On'. If you wish to limit the size of the buffer to a certain size - you can use a maximum number of bytes instead of 'On', as a value for this directive (e.g., output_buffering=4096). As of PHP 4.3.5, this directive is always Off in PHP-CLI."},{"name":"output_handler","suggested":" mb_output_handler or ob_iconv_handler(), ob_gzhandler() or zlib.output_compression;","documentation":"Use the first suggested values to handle character encoding.
