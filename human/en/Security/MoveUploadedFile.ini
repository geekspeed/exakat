name = "move_uploaded_file Instead Of copy";
description = "Always use move_uploaded_file() with uploaded files. Avoid using copy or rename with uploaded file. 

move_uploaded_file() checks to ensure that the file designated by filename is a valid upload file (meaning that it was uploaded via PHP's HTTP POST upload mechanism).

<?php

    // $a->file was filled with $_FILES at some point
    move_uploaded_file($a->file['tmp_name'], $target);

    // $a->file was filled with $_FILES at some point
    rename($a->file['tmp_name'], $target);

?>
