description = "The following cryptographic algorithms are considered unsecure, and should be replaced with new and more performant algorithms. 

``MD2``, ``MD4``, ``MD5``, ``SHA0``, ``SHA1``, ``CRC``, ``DES``, ``3DES``, ``RC2``, ``RC4``. 

When possible, avoid using them, may it be as PHP functions, or hashing function configurations (mcrypt, hash...).

<?php

// Weak cryptographic algorithm
echo md5('The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.');

// Weak crypotgraphic algorthim, used with a modern PHP extension (easier to update)
echo hash('md5', 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.');

// Strong crypotgraphic algorthim, used with a modern PHP extension
echo hash('sha156', 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.');

?>

Weak cryptography is commonly used for hashing values when caching them. In such cases, security is not a primary concern. However, it may later become such, when hackers get access to the cache folders, or if the cached identifier is published. As a preventive protection, it is recommended to always use a secure hashing function.
