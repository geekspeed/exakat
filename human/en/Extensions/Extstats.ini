It is a wrapper around 2 scientific libraries, namely `DCDFLIB <https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/cdflib/cdflib.html>`_ (Library of C routines for Cumulative Distributions Functions, Inverses, and Other parameters) by B. Brown & J. Lavato and `RANDLIB <http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f77_src/ranlib/ranlib.html>`_ by Barry Brown, James Lavato & Kathy Russell.
