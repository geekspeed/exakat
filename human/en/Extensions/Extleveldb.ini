LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that provides an ordered mapping from string keys to string values.

<?php

$db = new LevelDB($leveldb_path);

$batch = new LevelDBWriteBatch();
$batch->set('batch_foo', 'batch_bar');
$batch->put('batch_foo2', 'batch_bar2');
$batch->delete('batch_foo');

$db->write($batch);

$batch->clear();
$batch->delete('batch_foo2');
$batch->set('batch_foo', 'batch again');

?>
