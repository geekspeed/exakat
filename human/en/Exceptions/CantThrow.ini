name = "Can't Throw Throwable";
description = "Classes extending ``Throwable`` can't be thrown. The same applies to interfaces. 

Although this code lints, PHP throws a Fatal error when executing or including it : ``Class fooThrowable cannot implement interface Throwable, extend Exception or Error instead``.

<?php

// This is the way to go
class fooException extends \Exception { }

// This is not possible and a lot of work
class fooThrowable implements \throwable { }

?>
