name = "Compact Inexistant Variable";
description = "Compact() doesn't warn when it tries to work on an inexistant variable. It just ignores the variable.

This behavior changed in PHP 7.3, and compact() now emits a warning when the compacted variable doesn't exist.

<?php

function foo($b = 2) {
    $a = 1;
    // $c doesn't exists, and is not compacted.
    return compact('a', 'b', 'c');
}
?>

For performances reasons, this analysis only works inside methods and functions.
