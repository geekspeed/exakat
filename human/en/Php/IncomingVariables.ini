description = "Incoming names, used across the application. 

Incoming variables are first-level index in ``$_POST``, ``$_GET``, ``$_COOKIE``, ``$_REQUEST`` and ``$_FILE``;

``$_SESSION`` and ``$_ENV`` are not reported as incoming data, as they are not supposed to be manipulated by normal user. 

Dynamic names are not reported too.

$cookie = $_COOKIE['cookie'];

// 'archive' is the incoming variable, not 'file_name'
$file_name = $_FILE['archive']['file_name'];

// This is not reported, because it is from $_ENV.
$db_pass = $_ENV['DB_PASS'];

// This is not reported, because it is dynamic
$x = 'userId';
