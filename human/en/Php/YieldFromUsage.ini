name = "Yield From Usage";
description = "Usage of generator delegation, with ``yield from`` keyword.

In PHP 7, generator delegation allows you to yield values from another ``Generator``, ``Traversable`` object, or array by using the ``yield from``. 

``Yield from`` was introduced in PHP 7.1, and is backward incompatible.

<?php

// Yield delegation
function foo() {
    yield from bar();
}

function bar() {
    yield 1;
}

?>
