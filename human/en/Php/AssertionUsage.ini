description = "Usage of assertions, to add checks within PHP code.

Assertions should be used as a debugging feature only. You may use them for sanity-checks that test for conditions that should always be TRUE and that indicate some programming errors if not or to check for the presence of certain features like extension functions or certain system limits and features.

<?php

function foo($string) {
    assert(!empty($string), 'An empty string was provided!');
    
    echo '['.$string.']';
}

?>
