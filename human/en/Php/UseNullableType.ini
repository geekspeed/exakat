name = "Use Nullable Type";
description = "The code uses nullable type, available since PHP 7.1.

Nullable Types are an option to type hint : they allow the passing value to be null, or another type. 

According to the authors of the feature : 'It is common in many programming languages including PHP to allow a variable to be of some type or null. This null often indicates an error or lack of something to return.'

<?php

function foo(?string $a = 'abc') : ?string {
    return $a.b;
}

?>
