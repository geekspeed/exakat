name = "No Magic With Array";
description = "Magic method ``__get()`` doesn't work for array syntax. 

When overloading properties, they can only be used for scalar values, excluding arrays. Under the hood, PHP uses ``__get()`` to reach for the name of the property, and doesn't recognize the following index as an array. It yields an error : "Indirect modification of overloaded property".

<?php

class c {
    private $a;
    private $o = array();

    function __get($name) {
        return $this->o[$name];
    }
    
    function foo() {
        // property b doesn't exists
        $this->b['a'] = 3;
        
        print_r($this);
    }

    // This method has no impact on the issue
    function __set($name, $value) {
        $this->o[$name] = $value;
    }
}

$c = new c();
$c->foo();

?>

This is not reported by linting.

In this analysis, only properties that are found to be magic are reported. For example, using the b property outside the class scope is not reported, as it would yield too many false-positives.
