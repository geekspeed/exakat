description = "``Insteadof`` tries to replace a method with another, but it doesn't exists. This happens when the replacing class is refactored, and some of its definition are dropped. 

``Insteadof`` may replace a non-existing method with an existing one, but not the contrary. 

<?php

trait A {
    function C (){}
}

trait B {
    function C (){}
}

class Talker {
    use A, B {
        B::C insteadof A;
        B::D insteadof A;
    }
}

new Talker();
?>
