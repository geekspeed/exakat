description = "This report displays all dependencies between files. A file depends on another when it makes usage of one of its definitions : constant, functions, classes, traits, interfaces. 

For example, `A.php` depends on `B.php`, because `A.php` uses the function `foo`, which is defined in the `B.php` file. On the other hand, `B.php` doesn't depends on `A.php`, as a function may be defined, but not used. 

This diagramm shows which files may be used without others.

The resulting diagramm is a DOT file, which is readable with [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/about/). Those viewers will display the diagramm, and also convert it to other format, such as PNG, JPEG, PDF or others.  

Another version of the same diagramm is called Filedependencieshtml";
