description = "This report displays all dependencies between files. A file depends on another when it makes usage of one of its definitions : constant, functions, classes, traits, interfaces. 

For example, `A.php` depends on `B.php`, because `A.php` uses the function `foo`, which is defined in the `B.php` file. On the other hand, `B.php` doesn't depends on `A.php`, as a function may be defined, but not used. 

This diagramm shows which files may be used without others.

The resulting diagramm is in HTML file, which is readable with most browsers, from a web server. 

Warning : for browser security reasons, the report will NOT load as a local file. It needs to be served by an HTTP server, so all resources are correctly located.

Warning : large applicatoins (> 1000 files) will require a lot of resources to open.

Another version of the same diagramm is called Filedependencies, and produces a DOT file";
