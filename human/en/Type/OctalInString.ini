name = "Invalid Octal In String";
description = "Any octal sequence inside a string can't be beyond \377. Those will be a fatal error at parsing time. 

This is true, starting with PHP 7.1. In PHP 7.0 and older, those sequences were silently adapted (divided by \400).

<?php

// Emit no error in PHP 7.1
echo "\100"; // @

// Emit an error in PHP 7.1
echo "\500"; // @

?>
