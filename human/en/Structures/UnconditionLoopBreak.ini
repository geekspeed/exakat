name = "Unconditional Break In Loop";
description = "An unconditional break in a loop creates dead code. Since the break is directly in the body of the loop, it is always executed, creating a strange loop that can only run once. 

Here, break may also be a return, a goto or a continue. They all branch out of the loop. Such statement are valid, but should be moderated with a condition. 

<?php

// return in loop should be in 
function summAll($array) {
    $sum = 0;
    
    foreach($array as $a) {
        // Stop at the first error
        if (is_string($a)) {
            return $sum;
        }
        $sum += $a;
    }
    
    return $sum;
}

// foreach loop used to collect first element in array
function getFirst($array) {
    foreach($array as $a) {
        return $a;
    }
}
