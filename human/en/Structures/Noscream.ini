name = "@ Operator";
description = "@ is the 'no scream' operator : it suppresses error output. 

<?php

// Set x with incoming value, or else null. 
$x = @$_GET['x'];

?>

This operator is actually very slow : it will process the error all the way up, and finally decide not to display it. It is often faster to check the conditions first, then run the method without ``@``.

You may also set display_error to 0 in the ``php.ini`` : this will avoid user's error display, but will keep the error in the PHP logs, for later processing. 

The only situation where ``@`` is useful is when a native PHP function displays errors messages when error happens and there is no way to check it from the code. 

This is the case with fopen(), stream_socket_server(), token_get_all().
