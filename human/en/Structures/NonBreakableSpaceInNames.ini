name = "Non Breakable Space In Names";
description = "PHP allows non-breakable spaces in structures names, such as class, interfaces, traits, and variables.

This may be a nice trick to make names more readable outside code context, like long-named methods for tests. 

<?php

class class with non breakable spaces {}

class ClassWithoutNonBreakableSpaces {}

?>
